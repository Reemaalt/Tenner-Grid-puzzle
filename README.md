This project involves generating a Tenner Grid puzzle and solving it using three different algorithms:
Backtracking, Forward Checking, and Forward Checking with Minimum Remaining Values (MRV). 
The project initializes the grid randomly and evaluates the performance of each algorithm based on the number of consistency checks, variable assignments, and execution time.
